# Bullet Notes - Introduction to Dart Programming

## What's Dart?
Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform made by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, backend and web applications. 
Dart is Google's replacement for JavaScript.

### Variables
They are like containers which hold a value of a type.

**Declaring and naming variables**
We use camelCase to name variables, first define the type of variable, then variable name and then set it equal to a certain value.
  
```dart
  type name = value
```

Some examples of naming and declaring variables.
```dart
    int myAge = 25;
    String userName = 'Gurleen Sethi';
    double bonusAmount = 150300.56;
    bool isDoorOpen = true;
```

### print
The very simple function that allows us to print to the console anything we put between the parentheses.


### null
If you just declare a variable and not set it to any value, it will have value as null.
```dart
    int answerToUniverse;
    print(answerToUniverse); // prints null
    answerToUniverse = 42; // Book recommendation: Hitchhiker's guide to galaxy
```
Also, note that we are only using 'int' (the type) once when we declare variable. Later when we want to use that variable we don't write type in front of it.
So basically, declare a variable by mentioning the type of variable only once.


## Strings, Numbers, and Booleans
These are the most basic data types in Dart. 

### Strings

Strings are blocks of text, they will always be defined with quotation marks around them. **Any text with quotes around it is a string**. 

```dart
    String city = 'Jaipur';
    String game = 'Fortnite';
```
**All statements in Dart must end with semicolon** until unless you are writing blocks of code by using if/else, for loop, while loop, etc.

### Numbers

Numbers are classified into two further subcategories integer and decimal (double);
Numbers **do NOT** have quotes around them. 
They can be negative as well.  

```dart
    int age = 27;
    double temperature = 11.5;
    int savings = -1229;
```

## Math

Math operators work in Dart just as they would on your calculator.

### + - * / =
```
    1 + 1 = 2;
    2 * 2 = 4;
    2 - 2 = 0;
    2 / 2 = 1;
```

### %

Something you may not have seen before is the Modulo (`%`), this math operator will divide the two numbers and return the remainder.
```
    21 % 5 = 1;
    21 % 6 = 3;
    21 % 7 = 0;
```

### ~/
This is also a new operator which gets rid of decimal part and returns an integer value 
```
    350 ~/ 60 = 58; 
    75 ~/ 40 = 1
```

## Control Flow and Comparison Operators

 Control flow is a way for our program to check to see if something is `true`, and it will run the code supplied if it is, or moving on if it is not. For this we will use the `if` keyword:

```dart
    int age = 16;
    if (age > 15) {
        print('Not a child');
    }else{
        print('Is child');
    }
    
```

Here we are taking a variable (`age`) and checking to see if the statement is `true` (`16 > 15`), it is true, so we will print `Not a child`, and the program will skip the else block and continue. 
If it is not, it will skip the `if` block and then it will print `Is child`.

The "Greater Than" symbol ( `>` ) you see in the last example is called a Comparison Operator. 
Comparison Operators evaluate two numbers and return either `true` or `false`. 
These operators are: 
- `<` Less than
- `<=` Less than or equal to 
- `>` Greater than
- `>=` Less than or equal to 
- `==` Equal 
- `!=` Not equal

```dart
    1 > 2;     // false
    2 < 3;     // true
    10 >= 10;  // true
    100 <= 1;  // false
```

The "double equals" ( `==` ) must not be confused with a single equal sign (which indicates assigning a value to a variable). The double equal will compare everything about the two items, including type, and return if they are exactly equal or not:


```dart
    1 == 1;          // true
    1 == '1';        // false
    'cat' == 'cat';  // true
    'cat' == 'Cat';  // false
```

*Combining these operators with if/else*
```dart
    if ( (1 + 1) == 2) {
        print('The expression is true!');
    }
```


## Logical Operators

We can also combine two equality expressions and ask if either of them is true, both of them are true, or neither of them is true. To do this we will use Logical Operators.

### && - AND

The first logical operator we will look at is the "AND" operator. It is written with two ampersands (`&&`). This will evaluate both expressions and will return true if *BOTH* expressions are true. If one (or both) of them is false this operator will return false:

```dart
    if (100 > 10 && 10 === 10) {
        print('Both statements are true, so this code will be run');
    }
    
    if (10 === 9 && 10 > 9) {
        print('One of the statements is false, so the && will return false, this code will not be run');
    } else {
        print('Instead this will run.')
    }
```

### ||

The next is the "OR" operator. It is written with two vertical bars (`||`). It will determine if one of the expressions is `true`. It will return `true` if one (or both) of the expressions is `true`. It will return `false` if BOTH expressions are `false`:

```dart
    if (100 > 10 || 10 === 10) {
        print('Both statements are true, so this code will be run');
    }
    
    if (10 === 9 || 10 > 9) {
        print('One of the statements is true so the || will return true, this code will be run');
    } 

    if (10 === 9 || 1 > 9) {
        print('Both of the statements are false, so the || will return false. This code will not be run.');
    } 
```

### Assigning values to boolean variables
You may encounter scenarios where you want to use boolean variables again and again. In that case, we can evaluate logical expressions and store them in `bool` type variables.

```dart
    int age = 19;
    bool isAdult = age >= 19;
``` 
In this example first condition `age >= 19` is evaluated, and whatever is the outcome of that, it is assigned to `isAdult` variable.

```dart
    String dayOfWeek = 'Tuesday';
    bool is19Greater = 19 > 17; // true
    bool isFriday = dayOfWeek == 'Friday'; // false
```

# String Interpolation
Many times we want to print a statement with a variable inside it for example:

    "I spent 5 hours studying"
Here 5 is something you are calculating in your program and hence it is stored in a variable. So how will you print it right now?
```dart
  int hours = 5;
    print('I spent ');
    print(hours);
    print(' hours studying');
```
There should be a better way to do this, right? Because the current output is not even readable.    

Here comes interpolation to the rescue. With '$' sign inside quotes you can reference any variable you want. Something like this:
     
```dart
  int hours = 5;
    print('I spent $hours hours studying');
```

# Loops

Most software runs on loops, evaluating expressions over and over again until it either returns what we are looking for or stops after a certain time. Dart has two looping expressions built into it 
While and For loops 

### WHILE Loop
Just like if condition, while loop also runs based on a condition, but unlike for loop which runs only once, while loop runs multiple times
For eg
```dart
    int count =0; // 1. Initialize counter
    while(count <= 10){ // 2. Check condition
      print(count); // 3. execute code 
      count = count + 1; // 4. update counter
    } 
```
The order of execution is like this: 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 ->3 ->4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 ... till the condition returns false

### for Loops
, the "for" loop. 
`for` loops have a unique syntax, similar to the `if` statement, but slightly more complex. First, we have the `for` keyword, followed by parentheses and then open and close braces. Within the parentheses, we will need three things. First, we must declare a variable, this is what the loop will be looping over. Then we will have a conditional expression, the loop will continue happening until this statement is `false`. Third, we will increment our variable. All three of these statements are separated by a semi-colon.

```dart
    for (     int i = 0        ;       i < 10       ;      i++      ) {
    // | 1. Initialize counter | 2. Check condition | 4. update counter |
        print(i); // 3. execute code 
    }
```

In this example we see that we initially set our `counter` variable to 0, the loop will run and each time it gets to the end, it will increase the counter by one. The for loop will then evaluate the conditional expression. If it is `true`, it will run again, if it is `false` it will stop running.

### The ++ operator

We saw in the last two examples the `++` operator. This is Dart shorthand for "Set the value of the variable to its current value plus one". There are a few more of these variable math/assignment shorthand expressions, we will visit them in upcoming lessons.

### Infinite Loops. 

It is possible to get your loop stuck in what we call an "Infinite Loop". You must make sure there is a way for the loop to end, take for example this loop:

```dart
    for (int i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {
        print(i);
    }
```
Because our conditional expression will ALWAYS be `true` (`i` will never be less than 0) this loop will essentially run forever. This will break your program and may crash your web browser, or computer.

# Introduction to Functions

In programming, the function is a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.
### Advantage of Function
- Code Re-usability
- Develop an application in a modular format.
- Easy to debug the program.
- Code optimization: No need to repeat a lot of code.

```dart
    void myFunc() {}
    String greeting(name){}
```
### Anatomy of a Function

```dart
    void myFunc() {}
```

A function will start with the return type, this tells what is the outcome of your function. It can be the case that you don't have any output, in that case, we will use `void`. After that comes the name of the function, we like to give functions names that describe what they do. 
Then comes an open and a closed parenthesis. And finally, open and close brackets. In between these brackets is where all of our function code will go.

```dart
    // declaring function
    void printsHello() {
        print('hello');
    }

    printsHello(); // calling the function
```

In this example we declare a function `logsHello` and we set it up to `print` `'hello'`. We can then see to run this function, we need to write the name and parentheses. This is the syntax to run a function. A function always needs parentheses to run.

### Arguments

Now that we can run a basic function, we are going to start passing it arguments. 
If we add a variable to the parentheses when we declare the function we can use this variable within our function. We initiate the value of this variable by passing it into the function when we call it. So in this case `name = 'Ram'`. We can pass other variables into this as well:

```dart
    void logsHello(name) {
        print( `Hello, ${name}`);
    }

    String myName = 'Ram';
    logsHello(myName);
```

We can add multiple arguments by placing a comma in between them:

```dart
    int addsTwoNumbers(a, b) {
      int sum = a + b;
      return sum;
    }

    addsTwoNumbers(1, 5); // 6
```
### Return statement 

In the last example, we introduced the `return` statement. We will not `print` everything that comes out of a function. Most likely we will want to return something. In this case, it is the sum of the two numbers. Think of the return statement as the only way for data to escape a function. Nothing other than what is returned can be accessed outside of the function. Also note, that when a function hits a return statement, the function immediately stops what it is doing and returns.

```dart
    double dividesTwoNumbers(a, b) {
      double product = a / b;
      return product;
    }

    dividesTwoNumbers(6, 3); // 2
```

We can also set variables to equal what a function returns.

```dart
    int subtractsTwoNumbers(a, b) {
      int difference = a - b;
      return difference;
    }

    int differenceValue = subtractsTwoNumbers(10, 9); 
    print(differenceValue); // 1
```
