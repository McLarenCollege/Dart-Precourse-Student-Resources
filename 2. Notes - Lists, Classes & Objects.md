## Introduction to Lists

In the previous lessons we discussed the basic data types (strings, numbers, and booleans), and how to assign those data types to variables. We discussed how a variable can only point to a single string, number, or boolean. In many cases though we want to be able to point to a collection of data types. For example what if we wanted to keep track of every student's name in this class using a single variable, `studentNames`. We can do that using Lists. We can think of Lists as storage containers for collections of data. Building an list is simple, declare a variable and set it to []. We can then add however many strings, numbers, or booleans as we want to the container (comma separated), and access those items whenever we want.

```dart
    List studentNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];
```

### .length

```dart
    List studentNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];

    print(studentNames.length);  // 4
```
Just like this, String data type also has a built in `.length` method. In fact the list has a lot of useful built in methods. Just like the string `.length` counts the characters, list `.length` will return the number of items in an list:

### Accessing Items in an list

We can access an item at anytime in an list, we just need to call the item by its index in the list. Items are given a numerical position (index) according to where it is in the list, in order. A list's numerical order ALWAYS starts at 0, so the first item is in the 0 index, the second in the 1 index, the third in the 2, and so on (this can be tricky at first, but just remember Lists always start at 0). 

```dart
    List studentNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];
                           0       1        2      3
```

In order to access the item, we will type the name or the list variable, followed by brackets containing the numerical assignment.

```dart
    List studentNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];

    print(studentNames[1]);  // 'Arnav'
```

To dynamically access the last item in the list, we will use the `.length` method. In our `studentNames` list, the length is 4. We know the first item is always going to be 0, and every item after is shifted over one number. So in our example the last item has an index of 3. Using our length property we will show how it is done when we don't know the number of items in an list:

```dart
    List studentNames = ['Arnav', 'Priya', 'Raj','Sunil'];

    print(studentNames[studentNames.length - 1]);  // 'Raj'
    // OR
    print(studentNames.last);
```

### Assignment

We can assign and reassign any index in the list using the bracket/index and an =. 

```dart
    List studentNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];

    studentNames[0] = 'Ramesh';

    print(studentNames);  // ['Ramesh', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil']
```


### .add & .remove

Two more very useful built in list methods are `.add` and `.remove`. These methods refer to the adding and removing of items from the list after it's initial declaration.

`.add` adds an item to the end of the list, incrementing it's length by 1.

```dart
    List studentsNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];

    studentNames.add('Ryan');

    print(studentNames);  // ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil', 'Ryan']
```

`.remove` removes the item passed in, if item is not found it doesn't do anything.

```dart
    List studentsNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];

    studentNames.remove('Raj');
  
    print(studentNames);  // ['Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil']
    studentNames.removeAt(2);
    print(studentNames);  // ['Arnav', 'Priya']
```
 
 
## for Loops

Most of the time, for loops are used to iterate over all of the items in an list. Using the index access technique we can access each item in the list. To do this, we use the `.length` method as the stopping point for the loop.

```dart
    List studentsNames = ['Raj', 'Arnav', 'Priya', 'Sunil'];

    for (let i = 0; i < studentNames.length; i++) {
        print(studentNames[i]);
    }

    // 'Raj'
    // 'Arnav'
    // 'Priya'
    // 'Sunil'
```

### For each loop in lists

```dart
    for(String name in studentNames) {
       print(name);
    }
```

# Classes and Objects
Imagine if you have to maintain record of all students and their respective scores, you will have to create two lists like this:

```dart
    List studentNames = ["Arnav", "Mark", "Raj"];
    List scores = [60, 80, 70];
    // loop over to get individual info
    for (int i = 0; i < studentNames.length; i++){
        String name = studentNames[i];
        int score = scores[i];
        print('$name has a score of $score');
    }
``` 
You will make sure that name at first place (index 0) has his score at first place in scores list as well. This kind of structure is not common in programming mainly because it is very difficult to maintain order.
Every time there is a new student you will have to create a new score entry also for him other wise your data will be inconsistent.
```dart
    studentNames.add('Nithya');
    scores.add(75);
```

It is even more difficult when you have to remove a student, because then if you forget to remove the corresponding score you wont even get any error but data would be wrong in that case.
```dart
    studentNames.remove("Arnav");
    // if you dont remove score also, the program fails to give correct info
```

In such scenario, Classes are very helpful. 
Think of `class` as a blueprint where you can define required fields `name` and `score`, and now every student you create using that class will have a name and score. It simplifies and keep your code clean and hence you get to stay sane for longer.

To define a class, we use `class` keyword and define it like this. Remember classes are defined outside the main function.
```dart
    class Student {
        // Class fields
        String name;
        int score;
        // Constructor 
        Student(String name, int score){
          this.name = name;
          this.score = score;
        }
    }
```
To use this class and create a object (or instance) of this class we need to define a constructor. A constructor is a special function inside the class whose name is exact same as the class name. The purpose of having a constructor is to initialize the variables defined in the class as you can see in above example.

### Creating an object 
```dart
    Student student1 = Student("Arnav", 80);
    
    Student student2 = Student("Mark", 80);
    
    Student student3 = Student("Raj", 70);
    
    List students = [student1, student2, student3];
    students.removeAt(1);

    for (int i = 0; i < students.length; i++){
        String name = students[i].name;
        int score1 = students[i].score1;
        int score2 = students[i].score2;
        print('$name has scores of $score1 and $score2');
      }
```
We have created 3 `Student` objects with different names and scores, and then added them in a list called `students`
This code is similar to the lists code we did before but it is much more efficient and scalable.

### class methods
A lot of times we need to create functions specifically for classes. For example, I want to print something better than just name, like `Arnav has scored 75 marks in exam`
To do that we can define a function inside the class which can only be called via a class object.

```dart
  class Student {
        // Class fields
        String name;
        int score;
            // Constructor 
        Student(String name, int score){
          this.name = name;
          this.score = score;
        }
        void printDetails(){
          print('$name has scored $score marks in the exam');
        }
    }
``` 
Now to use it I can simply say

```dart
    Student student3 = Student("Raj", 70);
    student3.printDetails(); // Raj has scored 70 marks in the exam
```

### for each loop with classes

```dart
    for (Student student in students){
      print(student.name);  
    }
```
